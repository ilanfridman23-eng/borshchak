    { type: "paragraph", content: "If you're a small business owner, developer, or simply a resident of Ohio facing the prospect of divorce, you're likely concerned about how your assets will be divided. One of the most common—and emotionally charged—questions is what happens to inheritance money during a divorce. Is it protected as separate property, or can it be considered a marital asset and divided between spouses? The answer isn't always straightforward, and it can have a significant impact on your financial future." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Inheritances often come with deep personal significance, and the thought of losing part of a family legacy during a divorce can be distressing. Ohio law provides some guidance, but the reality is that how inheritance is treated depends on a variety of factors, including how the money was handled during the marriage, whether it was commingled with marital funds, and if any legal agreements (like a prenuptial agreement) are in place. Understanding your rights and the nuances of Ohio divorce law is essential for protecting your interests." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down the legal framework surrounding inheritance in Ohio divorces, explore real-world scenarios, and provide practical tips for safeguarding your inheritance. Whether you're just beginning the divorce process or want to plan ahead, this article will equip you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes." },

    { type: "heading", content: "Inheritance and Divorce in Columbus: What You Need to Know" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Columbus residents facing divorce often wonder how inherited assets will be treated. In Ohio, the law distinguishes between \"marital property\" and \"separate property.\" Generally, inheritance received by one spouse—whether before or during the marriage—is considered separate property. This means it's not subject to division in a divorce. However, there are important exceptions and pitfalls that can turn an inheritance into a marital asset." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "The key factor is how the inheritance is handled. If you receive money or property from a relative and keep it in a separate account, never mixing it with joint funds or using it for marital expenses, it will likely remain your separate property. But if you deposit that inheritance into a joint bank account, use it to pay for shared expenses, or invest it in a jointly owned home or business, it may become \"commingled.\" Commingling can convert all or part of your inheritance into marital property, making it subject to division." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "For example, let's say you inherit $100,000 from an aunt and use $50,000 of it as a down payment on a house titled in both your and your spouse's names. In this case, the court may consider that portion of the inheritance as marital property. Documentation is crucial—maintain clear records of how you received and used your inheritance. If you're unsure about your situation, consulting a divorce attorney in Columbus can help clarify your rights and options." },
    { type: "heading", content: "How Inheritance Is Treated in Divorce in Columbus, OH" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "In Columbus, OH, the division of assets during divorce is governed by Ohio Revised Code Section 3105.171. This statute outlines what counts as marital property and what is considered separate property. Inheritances, by default, are classified as separate property. However, the real-world application of this law is more nuanced than it may seem." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "The court will examine how the inheritance was managed after it was received. If you kept inherited funds in your name alone and never used them for joint purposes, you have a strong case for keeping them as separate property. But if you used inherited money to renovate a jointly owned home, pay down a joint mortgage, or fund a family vacation, those funds may be deemed marital property. This is especially true if the inheritance was deposited into a joint account or if you cannot \"trace\" the funds back to their source." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Tracing is the process of proving that the money or property in question originated from an inheritance and was not mixed with marital assets. If you can provide clear documentation, such as bank statements or legal documents, you have a better chance of protecting your inheritance. If tracing is not possible, the court may presume the asset is marital property. Because these cases can be complex, working with a knowledgeable divorce lawyer in Columbus, OH, is often the best way to safeguard your inheritance and ensure a fair outcome." },

    { type: "image", src: blogInheritance2, alt: "Bank vault with safe deposit boxes", variant: "float-right" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "In Columbus, Ohio, protecting your inheritance during divorce requires proactive planning and a clear understanding of the law. Ohio courts generally respect the distinction between separate and marital property, but the burden of proof is on the spouse claiming the inheritance as separate. This means you must be able to show, with documentation, that the asset was inherited and kept apart from marital property." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "If you anticipate receiving an inheritance or have already received one, consider keeping it in a separate account titled only in your name. Avoid using inherited funds for joint expenses, paying off marital debts, or investing in jointly owned property. Even well-intentioned actions—like using inherited money to fix up the family home—can jeopardize your claim to the asset." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "If you're already in the midst of a divorce, gather all available documentation: wills, bank statements, transfer records, and any correspondence related to the inheritance. The more evidence you have, the stronger your case will be. For complex situations, such as inherited business interests or real estate, it's wise to consult with a local attorney who understands Ohio's property division laws and can help you develop a strategy to protect your interests." },
    { type: "heading", content: "What Counts as Separate Property in an Ohio Divorce?" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "To fully understand how inheritance is treated in an Ohio divorce, it's important to clarify the concept of \"separate property.\" Under Ohio law, separate property includes assets acquired by one spouse before the marriage, gifts received by one spouse, and inheritances given specifically to one spouse, regardless of when they were received. This means that if you inherit money or property in your name only, and you keep it separate, it generally remains yours after the divorce." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "However, the court will scrutinize the handling of these assets. If you mix your inheritance with marital funds—such as depositing it into a joint account or using it to purchase jointly titled property—the court may determine that all or part of the inheritance has lost its separate status. This is known as \"commingling.\" The more you can do to keep your inheritance isolated, the stronger your legal position if divorce occurs." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Separate property can also include compensation for personal injury, property excluded by a valid prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, and any passive income or appreciation from these assets, provided they remain separate. If you're unsure whether a particular asset qualifies as separate property, consult with a legal professional for guidance tailored to your situation." },
    { type: "heading", content: "The Dangers of Commingling: When Inheritance Becomes Marital Property" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Commingling is one of the biggest risks to keeping your inheritance protected during a divorce. In Ohio, if you combine inherited money with marital assets, you may inadvertently convert it into marital property. This can happen in a variety of ways—depositing inheritance funds into a joint checking account, using them to pay off shared debts, or investing in a family home or business co-owned with your spouse." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Once commingled, it can be extremely difficult to prove which portion of the asset is still separate. The court may require you to \"trace\" the inheritance back to its source, and if you can't, it may be divided just like any other marital asset. The burden of proof falls on the spouse claiming the asset is separate. Without clear records, you could lose a significant portion of your inheritance." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "To avoid this, keep inherited assets in accounts titled only in your name, and do not use them for joint purposes. If you've already commingled, gather as much documentation as possible to help trace the funds. If you're unsure about your situation, seek professional advice before making any financial moves that could impact your rights." },

    { type: "image", src: blogInheritance3, alt: "Family photo album open on a table", variant: "full" },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Tracing is a critical process in Ohio divorce cases involving inheritance. If you want to claim that an asset is your separate property, you must be able to prove its origin and show that it was not commingled with marital assets. This often requires meticulous record-keeping and sometimes the assistance of financial experts." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "The court will look for a clear \"paper trail\" connecting your inheritance to the current asset. For example, if you inherited $50,000 and kept it in a separate savings account, you will need to provide bank statements showing the initial deposit and no subsequent mixing with marital funds. If you used inherited money to buy a car in your name only, the title and purchase documents will support your claim." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "If tracing is not possible—because records are missing or the funds were mixed with marital assets—the court may presume the asset is marital property. This is why it's so important to maintain detailed records and avoid commingling whenever possible. If your situation is complex, a forensic accountant or legal expert can help reconstruct the history of your inheritance and strengthen your case in court." },

These legal contracts allow couples to define in advance how certain assets—including inheritances—will be treated in the event of divorce. In Ohio, prenuptial agreements are enforceable as long as they are entered into voluntarily, with full disclosure, and are not unconscionable." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "If you expect to receive a significant inheritance, consider discussing a prenuptial agreement with your future spouse. You can specify that any inheritance received by either party will remain separate property, regardless of how it is used or titled. This can prevent disputes and provide peace of mind for both spouses." },
    { type: "paragraph", content: "Even if you're already married, a postnuptial agreement can offer similar protections.
